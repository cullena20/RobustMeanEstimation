    Returns a mean estimate based on semi definite programming.

    Parameters:
    data (np.ndarray): A 2D array where rows represent samples and columns represent features.
    tau: expected corruption
    hard_cutoff: if True, outliers with weights below a cutoff are pruned; otherwise outliers are only weighted
    cutoff: the cutoff used for hard_cutoff
    original_threshold: if False, uses threshold in constraint to account for low data size, if True, uses method
